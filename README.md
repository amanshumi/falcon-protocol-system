## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Design
The Falcon Suppression List System is designed as a scalable microservice that integrates with ad serving infrastructure. The system follows a three-tier architecture with clear separation between storage, business logic, and integration layers. The core components include a Suppression List Manager for data persistence, an Enhanced Falcon Server for real-time ad serving decisions, and Advanced Features for production-grade capabilities.

The system processes ad requests by checking user identifiers against advertiser-specific suppression lists in real-time, with optimizations for high-volume traffic. It supports multiple identifier types and provides comprehensive management interfaces for advertisers while maintaining sub-millisecond response times for suppression checks.

### Technology Choices
| Component | Technology | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Storage | SQLite (dev) / Redis+PostgreSQL (prod) | SQLite for simplicity in development, with migration path to distributed databases for production |
| Boilerplate Usage | Extended and Enhanced | Used provided boilerplate as foundation, enhanced with production features and proper initialization |
| Suppression Index | Optimized SQL indexes + In-memory LRU cache | SQL indexes for persistent storage, LRU cache for hot data with O(1) lookup performance |
| API Framework | Node.js with modular design | High performance for I/O-bound operations, excellent ecosystem for ad tech |
| Validation | Custom validators with lenient sample support | Ensures data integrity while accommodating real-world sample data formats |

### Data Models
**Core Entities:**
- `SuppressionLists`: Metadata about lists (id, advertiser_id, name, identifier_type, timestamps, size)
- `SuppressionIdentifiers`: Individual identifiers with efficient indexing (identifier_hash, identifier, list_id, advertiser_id)
- Relationships: One advertiser → Many suppression lists → Many identifiers

**Key Design:**
- Normalized schema for data integrity
- Hash-based indexing for fast lookups
- Timestamp tracking for temporal operations
- Active/inactive flags for list management

### Multi-Advertiser Suppression Strategy
- **Suppression Lists**: Each advertiser manages independent lists with proper isolation and access control
- **User-to-Advertiser Mapping**: Reverse index (identifier → advertiser IDs) built during list loading for O(1) lookups during ad serving
- **Temporal Handling**: Lists are versioned with creation/submission timestamps, supporting incremental updates and expiration policies based on last_updated fields

## Implementation Details

### Part 1: Basic Storage
- **Storage Mechanism**: SQLite database with optimized schema design, transaction support, and connection pooling
- **Data Structure**: Normalized relational model with separate tables for list metadata and identifiers, supporting efficient CRUD operations and complex queries
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete with atomic transactions, proper error handling, and validation
- **Key Challenges**: Ensuring data consistency during concurrent operations, optimizing index design for million-scale identifiers, handling initialization race conditions

### Part 2: List Management
- **Validation Strategy**: Multi-level validation supporting both strict production formats and lenient sample data, with regex patterns for email_hash (50-70 char hex) and device_id (UUID/iosdevice formats)
- **Import/Export**: Stream-based CSV processing with batch operations, error resilience, and progress tracking; JSON support for configuration data
- **Deduplication**: Set-based algorithm with identifier normalization (case-insensitive, format standardization) and batch processing for memory efficiency
- **Metrics**: Real-time tracking of list counts, identifier volumes, storage utilization, and operation performance with aggregation capabilities

### Part 3: Ad Server Integration
- **Boilerplate Usage**: Extended FalconServer with enhanced suppression logic while maintaining full compatibility with provided ad server; modified initialization sequence for proper component lifecycle
- **Suppression Logic Implementation**: Implemented efficient `loadSuppressionLists()` using database batch loading and `checkUserSuppression()` with multi-identifier support and proper error handling
- **Multi-Advertiser Handling**: Reverse index mapping identifiers to advertiser sets, enabling O(1) lookups and efficient aggregation of suppression decisions across multiple advertisers
- **Performance Optimizations**: LRU caching with TTL, connection pooling, prepared statements, efficient data structures (Sets), and asynchronous initialization
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test suite using provided mock data, validating all sample test cases with 100% pass rate, including edge cases and error scenarios

### Part 4: Advanced Features
**Implemented Features**: 
1. **List Expiration & Data Retention**: Automated cleanup with configurable TTL policies, supporting GDPR-compliant data lifecycle management
2. **Privacy Compliance & Encryption**: One-way hashing for identifiers, AES-256 encryption for sensitive data, and audit trails for compliance reporting
3. **A/B Testing & Sampling**: Percentage-based suppression for gradual rollouts and experimentation, with configurable sampling rates
4. **Audit Logging & Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive operation tracking and API protection with sliding window algorithm

## Production Architecture

### Scalability Plan
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless Falcon servers behind load balancer, Redis cluster for distributed caching, database read replicas
- **Performance Targets**: 10ms P99 for suppression checks, 1M+ identifiers per advertiser, 10K+ RPS per instance
- **Database Strategy**: Sharding by advertiser_id, connection pooling, read/write separation, with migration path from SQLite to PostgreSQL/Redis

### Reliability & Fault Tolerance
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fail-fast patterns for dependent services with exponential backoff retry
- **Graceful Degradation**: Serve ads without suppression when system is overloaded or components fail
- **Data Redundancy**: Multi-region database replication with automated failover
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks with auto-healing and alerting

### Security & Compliance
- **Data Protection**: AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, secure key management
- **Privacy Features**: One-way hashing of PII, data minimization principles, right to erasure support
- **Access Control**: RBAC with advertiser isolation, API rate limiting, audit trails
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA-ready with data retention policies and consent management hooks

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Key Metrics**: Suppression check latency, cache hit ratios, error rates, database performance, memory usage
- **Alerting**: P99 latency > 50ms, error rate > 1%, cache hit ratio < 80%, storage utilization > 80%
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs, log levels, and automated retention

### Deployment Strategy
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime updates with instant rollback capability
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollouts of new functionality with percentage-based activation
- **Database Migrations**: Forward-compatible schema changes with automated rollback procedures
- **Canary Testing**: 1% traffic to new versions initially, with progressive ramp-up

- Efficient algorithms and data structures for high-volume operations
- Proper error handling and graceful degradation strategies

### What Could Be Improved
- More extensive performance benchmarking with larger datasets
- Additional security penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
- Enhanced documentation for API consumers and integration guides
- More configuration options for fine-tuning performance parameters

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of proper async initialization sequences in Node.js applications
- Value of comprehensive audit trails for both debugging and compliance
- Benefits of feature flags for gradual rollouts and experimentation
- Need for balancing strict validation with practical real-world data handling

### AI Tool Effectiveness
For this project, I have used DeepSeek R1, and it was extremely helpful for:
- Generating boilerplate code quickly while maintaining quality
- Exploring alternative architectural patterns and best practices
- Identifying edge cases and potential failure scenarios
- Optimizing database query performance and indexing strategies

Surprisingly effective at understanding complex ad tech requirements and suggesting industry-standard approaches, though required careful validation of generated code for production readiness.

But I have observed some problems while trying to get assistance on fixing bugs, which I had to unfortunately explore and fix them myself along the way.
